I am currently applying to jobs for my year abroad and I have found one in Paris which I really like the look of. It is a start up company which specialises in replenishing stock on websites! It sounds so cool because it means whenever you want to buy something it'll be in stock due to this company. I really want the job so I am learning how to use Github well as my profile link is required for when I apply.
